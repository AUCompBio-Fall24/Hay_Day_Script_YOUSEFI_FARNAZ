This is **My Hey Day Script** repository! 
I'm trying to celebrate Auburn University **Hey Day**, one of Auburn's oldest and most beloved **traditions**. where everyone on campus greets each other with a cheerful **"Hey!"** and helping everyone feel a sense of belonging. 
Dating all the way back to 1947, students who served in **WWII** were returning back to normalcy here at Auburn University, but upon their return, they felt unseen and unheard here on campus. In response, Auburn Universityâ€™s student body and members of the Student Government Association pushed for a day that would **unite the Auburn Family** and promote a friendly atmosphere known as **Hey Day!**
